Uses Machine learning to detect the quality of Water using the values of dissolved oxygen(do) in water and pH of Water.

To run this project:


**step 1:** Create a virtual environment to install all the dependencies `pip3 install pip env`

**step 2:** `pip3 install requirements`

**step 3:** To run the project use `python manage.py runserver`

**step 4:** set your value of dissolved oxygen in range 0-100 mg/L 

**step 5:** set the value of pH in range 1-14 

**step 6:** You will get the quality of Water either Good, Bad or Very Bad.


This is a Machine Learning project that I tried and along with that I made a website to see the result.
We collected the Water quality from the Government of India website.
Then train those using ML algorithms like Multi linear regression, logistic regreesion.
It was based on Supervised Learning techniques as we were given the labelled data.
We had to manually collect those data as we didn't find any api to collect them.
